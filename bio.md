## longer version

Gleb Bahmutov is a JavaScript ninja, image processing expert, and software quality fanatic. After receiving a PhD in computer science from Purdue University, Gleb worked on laser scanners, 3D reconstruction, and panorama-based virtual tours at EveryScape. Next Gleb switched to writing browser data visualization software at MathWorks. After a year, Gleb went back to the startup environment and developed software quality analysis tools at uTest (now Applause). He then moved on to build the front end and Node services at Kensho - a financial analysis startup, whose web application is used by the top five world banks. Then he spent 4 years building the best open-source end-to-end test runner at [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) as its VP of Engineering at first, and a Distinguished Engineer later on.

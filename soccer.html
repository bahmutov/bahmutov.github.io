    <h1>Neon Green Spring Season Prep</h1>
    <main>
      <p>We want to start the spring season in a good form. During winter months if you do not practice, you might slump.
        By doing even a few moves twice a week you will keep your feet engaged and be ready to play well in the spring.
        Please use the Spring Season prep <a href="./pdf/prep.pdf">sheet</a>.
        Mark the weeks when you did both exercises, there will be a prize for the player with the most filled weeks</p>
